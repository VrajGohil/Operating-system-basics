These are the various scheduling algorithms used in operating system. 

A Process Scheduler schedules different processes to be assigned to the CPU based on particular scheduling algorithms. There are six popular process scheduling algorithms which we are going to discuss in this chapter âˆ’
<ul><li>First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling</li>
<li>Shortest-Job-Next (SJN) Scheduling</li>
<li>Priority Scheduling</li>
<li>Shortest Remaining Time</li>
<li>Round Robin(RR) Scheduling</li>
<li>Multiple-Level Queues Scheduling</li></ul>
